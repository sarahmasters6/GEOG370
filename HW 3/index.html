    <p>Cylindrical projections have a central meridian and right angles. Lines are all parallel and distortion increases as you move from the equator to the poles since the equator is touching the so-called cylinder.</p>

    <p>Conic projections result from placing a cone on the Earth and unwrapping it. The angles are acute and the most distortion is at the bottom of the image.</p>
